# Click Click Revolution

[CCR Live](https://lisalamm22.github.io/ccr/)

CCR is a rhythm game that requires precise mouse movements and keypress timing. Integrates object-oriented Javascript game structure with smooth rendering of HTML5 canvas and HTML5 audio elements to foster an immersive and upbeat game environment.

## Gameplay
Players will receive visual circular prompts that indicate where to aim the cursor and when to press. These prompts correspond with the beats of the audio and timing of the keypress is essential to scoring high.

## Implementation
###Game Rendering
A ```js GameView ``` class renders the game, using a ```js requestAnimationFrame ``` loop to maintain a constant 60fps refresh rate. 
The GameView keeps track of all game objects including the Beat, audio element, and player position/activity.
The GameView is responsible for checking the success of a players click/keypress for beats that are active.
```js
//iterate through beatmap to find activebeats and draw on canvas
this.game.redraw(this.ctx);
if (this.game.beats.length !== 0) {
    this.game.beats.forEach((beat, idx) => {
        this.isActiveBeat(beat, idx, this.lastTime)
        if(beat.type === "CLICK"){
            this.drawBeat(beat, this.lastTime)
        }
        else{
            this.drawDrag(beat, this.lastTime)
            if(beat.held){
                this.checkDrag(beat, this.lastTime)
            }
        }
    })
}
if (this.restart){
    return null
} else if(this.pause){
    return null
} else{
    requestAnimationFrame(this.animate.bind(this));
}
```

### Beatmaps
The game canvas sizes itself dynamically based on window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight. To ensure beatmaps display at scale, positions for each beat are scalar values rather than absolute values:
```js
const Beatmap = [
    { pos: [0.5, 0.5], time: 2410},
    { pos: [0.44, 0.44], time: 3000},
    { pos: [0.38, 0.5], time: 3630},
    { pos: [0.44, 0.44], time: 4200},
    { pos: [0.38, 0.5], time: 4790},
]
```

### Displaying Beats
The GameView delegates rendering and passes on the proper parameters to the Beat. 
Since timing is crucial, dynamic rings guide the player to the optimal timing to hit a beat. 
Once a beat is hit in the proper active time, the player receives visual feedback indicating a success. 
```js
if (Math.abs(timeDelta) <= beatTime) {    
    if(Object.keys(this.hitBeats).includes(JSON.stringify(beat))){
        let hitTime = this.hitBeats[JSON.stringify(beat)]
        this.drawHitBeat(this.ctx, beat, hitTime, time)
    }
    else if(timeDelta < -activeBeatT){
        let radiusMul = (-(timeDelta+ inactiveBeatT)/ inactiveBeatT) + 2;
        let opacity = (1+((timeDelta + inactiveBeatT) / inactiveBeatT));
        beat.drawClick(this.ctx, opacity);
        beat.drawRing(this.ctx, opacity, radiusMul, "white")
    }
}
```
